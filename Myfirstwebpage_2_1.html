    <h2> Data Visualization </h2>
    <p><img src="DataVizwebdev.png" width="500" height="320" alt="Scatterplot depicting Gender as the x axis and Salary as the y axis. The chart shows that men tend to earn more than women."></p>
    <h2> Why does this data matter? </h2>
      <p> The data above suggests that men do indeed still out earn women. While both men and women both seem to have low paying jobs, far more men that women seem to have high paying ones. If we look more closely at the data, there are no women who are making more than $120,000 a year, while there are several men who are. While this data is hardly a representation of the entire american population it does still highlight a concerning trend that men outweigh women. </p>
    <h2> Conclusions </h2>
      Tjis data indicates that according to this sample of men and women in the united States, that men still make more money than women. It does not indicate what positions these men and women are occupying and it is therefore imposiible to determine the exact cause for this descrepancy. This data is useful in taht in provides a starting point to analyze why and when women are paid less than men.
