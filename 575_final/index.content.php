<p>With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic,
Intensive Care Units all across America have become the center of media attention and part of a larger debate 
regarding the threshold for being admitted into the ICU, and the care recieved.
This page uses the lock5data set on ICU Admissions in order to try an paint a more complete picture of who gets admitted to the ICU,
what the average heart rate and systolic are for those admitted and the role of gender in survival.
</p>

<p>In order to paint this picture, 3 vizualizations were created using javascript along with 3 accompanying tables. 
The dataset contained variables such as sex, race, age, heartrate, systolic, status (dead or alive) and conscioussness.
</p>

<p>The data set revieled that far more whites are admitted than any other race. While this could be do to the sample size selected, 
it could also point to potential bias within the medical system.
